<h1> My Birthday </h1>

<p> Hitting the big 20 never took such a big toll on me. The more I would think about my life the more I would realize I am no where near where I want to be in life.</p>

<p> I pictured myself already living alone, nice job, with the person I wanted to marry and happy. But I barely have two of those four things.</p>

<p>It's hard to know the exact steps to take to get to where I want to be considering I have so many things I WANT to accomplish and I have an even bigger list of what I HAVE to accomplished. Maybe I'm still going about this wrong or I'm just not looking at the bigger picture.</p>

<p> My biggest struggle I've notived is my purpose. I still feel havent figure out what I'm here for. What can I do? Where can I go? and who gives a shit? clearly my self esteem is too low to set any insanely high stndards for myself. I always needed a reason to do what I needed to do. Many of the reasons have been temporary and I am searching for something more important than myself in order to accomplish what I need to get done.</p>
