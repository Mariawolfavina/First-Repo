I MADE IT TO WEEK THREE WOO!

>> Belive it or not people have been asking me about school constantly. They ask me what I do and what I'm learning. I don't know exaclty how to explain it since I'm still learning it myself. A lot of people find it weird that I'm going to school for such a long amount of time during one day. It sometimes makes me sad knowing half of my friends are out enjoying summer and I am spending it indoors either in class or making money.
>>I guess I can't really complain. Work hard now and play later, right?
