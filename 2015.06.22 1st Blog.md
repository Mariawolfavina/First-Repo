<h2> Disorganized </h2>

<p> Despite these last few days being very repetetive. I can't manage to proritize what I want to do with my life.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Not only am I loosin sleep but I am slowly loosing sight of what I am here for. I never wanted things to get as complicated as they are right now. Not knowing where the root of my stress is comming from, I am left with no other choice but to escape the things that I know are not meant to stay. The mere thought of the fact that there is a line between what I WANT to get rid of and what I NEED to get rid of is stressing me out just as much.</li>

	<li>I guess a place to start would be with my job considering working at a ghetto ass place really isn't much fun at all.</li>
</ul>
