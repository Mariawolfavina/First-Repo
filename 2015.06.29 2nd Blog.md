Week 2 Summary.

>> I'm growing tired. I don't know how much longer I can stand balancing my work-life, social-life and school-life. It is nearly impossible to find time to get all my work done and still look like decent enough to keep people from asking me, "are you okay? You look sick."

>> As you can tell, I am slowly loosing my sanity.
