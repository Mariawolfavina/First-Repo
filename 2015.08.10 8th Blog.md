<h1>BLOG POST WEEK 8</h1>

<p>Lately I've been hooked on this show called "Sons of Anarchy." It's like a soap opera but more violent. It's pretty awesome if you ask me, makes me think about life and how everybody has their own representations of what sacrafice is and what it means to them. Some people are willing to sacrafice sleep, eating, and themselves for a higher purpose. Others, on the other hand, would sacrafice family, friends and their own lives to protect their own for a higher purpose.</p>


<p>I'm at the part of the story where the family in the show has to keep a dark family secret from being exposed. Many innocent people have died because one person decided to save themselves rather than come clean and face their fate. I have not reached the end of the series so I am unsure of what the outcome is going to be. Thus far, things just keep getting worse.</p>


<p>Now, I wouldn't compare my life to a motorcycle gang that deals drugs and guns; but, I could relate to the stress that comes with doing everything possible to acheive a highe purpose without loosing too much of what built me in the first place. If that makes any sence.</p>


<p>The amount of stress I've undergone in the past few months has made me notice some hair loss and an increase in weight. I've had numerous people apporach me as well to talk about job opportunities they would like to hire me for. I recently got offered a job position as a teller at Summit Credit Union. Even though working at a bank is one of my many dreams, so is becoming a graphic designer and working with computers. I'm torn between taking one of my dream jobs and working at a bank or waiting on an internship of a lifetime. Currently being employed at PLS Check Cashers gives me the ghetto experience of working in a setting that closely resembles that of a bank.</p>


<p>These "problems" may not be a big deal to other people but, when I take into consideration my future I want to make sure I end up somewhere where I feel content. I'm alread a few months into my 20's and all the progress I've been making hasn't been enough on my view. Lately I've been thinking more about death and how uncomplete I would feel if I were to die tomorrow. I have not appreciated my life as much as I should.</p>


<p>I went shopping with my mom the other day at the mall. At one point I got mad because I lost her in the store and went looking for her for 10 minutes. She wouldn't answer her phone and I was growing impatient. When I found her I was angry and I scolded her for not answering her phone. Almost instantly, I started thinking about how much I appreciate her presence in my life. I started thinking about how devistated I would be if she were to pass away so soon. I kept looking at her and thinking about how I should show her I love her more than show her how mad she makes me sometimes. I've come to appreciate more of what I have in this world while I'm here, for I know my time will come and I will not leave behind the memory of how I never loved everything I had.</p>
